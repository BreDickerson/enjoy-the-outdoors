Enjoy the Outdoors 
<p>A National Parks webpage that was used to showcase my knowlegde of Javascript. I implemented the data provided to me inside of the project repository using innerHTML, and to design my project i used HTML and CSS to make it look more stylized. 
</p>
<p> The best part to me was styling my cards to make my project look nicer! It was a bit frustating but after getting help from my classmates and instructor i am really proud in the way it looks! </p>
